 - Temperature and Humidity system. 
 - ESD Wrist Strap Checker system.
 - Iron Temperature Checker system.
 - Torque Driver Checker System.
 - SMT and HM Temperature Profile System.
 - Main Line Conveyor Tact Time (Speed and output estimate) - IoT.
 - Production (ML/SMT/HM) Output Timing. 
 - WIP Barcode system (SMT & HM).
 - Finish Good Warehouse Barcode System for shipment.

All of these have been improved Efficiency & Quality by 50% reduced man hour used using PHP, MySQL, JavaScript and Arduino.
