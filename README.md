# Smart Factory System Project

This project have been developed during i am working at manufacturing company. This is for easily the production monitoring process in order to get the good quality and efficiency target. It's included:
 
 - Main Page Smart Factory Dashboard.
 - Temperature and Humidity system. 
 - ESD Wrist Strap Checker system.
 - Iron Temperature Record system.
 - Torque Driver Checker System.
 - SMT and HM Temperature Profile System.
 - Main Line Conveyor Tact Time (Speed and output estimate) - IoT.
 - Production (ML/SMT/HM) Output Timing. 
 - WIP Barcode system (SMT & HM).
 - Finish Good Warehouse Barcode System for shipment.

All of these have been improved Efficiency & Quality by 50% reduced man hour used using PHP, MySQL, JavaScript and Arduino. The data collected in database is Real-Time data and Near Real-Time data.


1. **Main Page Smart Factory Dashboard** - This part have been read from MySQL and summarize it by display it in table view using PHP and javascript.

2. **Temperature and Humidity system** - This part is a device wifi temperature at all location have stored all the data in Real-Time to database and can check the graph by hour and daily in detail at this site.

3. **ESD Wrist Strap Checker system** - Since the workplace is deal with electronics part, so the staff need to check their ESD Wrist Strap daily. This part is to get a good quality of products.

4. **Iron Tip Temperature Record System** - In order to get good quality of soldering, it is the compulsory to check daily the iron tip temperature from the staff used follow by specification.

5. **Torque Driver Checker System** - In order to get good quality of products, it is the compulsory to check daily the torque driver from the staff used follow by specs of WSI for each model product.

6. **SMT and HM Temperature Profile System** - In order to get good quality of products, machine soldering temperature must be checked by tester device based on specification.

7. **Main Line Conveyor Tact Time (Speed and output estimate) - IoT** - To know what estimation output products of the day by know the speed of the conveyor in Real-Time.

8. **Production (ML/SMT/HM) Output Timing** - To ensure the output timing is within the target time. This part is using automation system and auto count PCB time and save to database.
